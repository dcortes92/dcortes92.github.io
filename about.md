I was Born in San Jose, Costa Rica. I started to get interested in computers when my dad bought a PC with windows 98 on it. I used it mostly for games until late middle school. When I started high school I began to code. My very first program was written in Pascal, dropping it no so long after to start coding in C.

After high school I got accepted to [TEC](http://www.tec.ac.cr/). I studied Computer Engineering and got a Bachelor Degree. I started working as a Front End Developer after graduated, but I got interested in Back End as well. I'm trying to always follow what's trending for Front End developers and learning other technologies not so related to what I do.

### More Information

In my spare time I like to play drums and football. I'm a big fan of [Liga Deportiva Alajuelense](http://www.twitter.com/ldacr) and [AC Milan](http://www.twitter.com/acmilan). I also have a passion for language learning, trilingual in progress and hopefully a polyglot some day.
