Hello all, my name is Daniel. This will be my blog for now on. I figured that I shouldn't wait until new year to publish
my blog. So here it is.

I will have ready the [about](/about/) section by the time this is up. I will write about mostly programming, 
but from time to time will rant about some other topics as well.

Smell ya later,

*Daniel*
